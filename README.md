# Pygame Lab #3 - Animation Part 1 (Using Lists & Loops)

## Step #1 - Background Info
* Review [Lesson 6.4 - Animation Part 2 (Using Lists & Loops)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gevzbYChrY1eZ8gAvzEp7KjQu0hE5XO6wreFM08l2sM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Step #2 - Create an animation using lists and loops
* Copy and paste your Pygame Lab #1 or #2 into the new assignment

#### How to achieve a:
* <ins>Level 1:</ins> Copies the falling snow tutorial
* <ins>Level 2:</ins> Animates the repetition of objects/shapes in the same manner as the tutorial 
  * Uses a list to store the [x, y] coordinate 
  * Uses a for loop to draw the objects/shapes in the locations stored in the list
  * Uses a for loop to move the objects/shapes in a downward direction (e.g. rain, falling leaves)
* <ins>Level 3:</ins>
  * Add an extra movement in the x-direction (in addition to the movement in the y-direction) (e.g. rain moving diagonally)
  * Move the objects/shapes only in the x-direction
  * Bounce the objects/shapes
* <ins>Level 4:</ins>
  * Animate multiple objects with the usage of a function from Lab #2 (e.g. moving multiple clouds)
  * Continuously draws the objects/shapes in different locations rather than having it “move” (e.g. fireworks, twinkling stars)
  * Continuously draws the object/shapes with different colours or changing colours (e.g. sunset/sunrise)
  * Continuously draws the object/shapes in different sizes (e.g. zooming in on an object, ball being thrown at the screen)

<b>Try to be creative with your animations!!<br>
If you have an idea that is not in the list above, let me know and I can tell you what level it will fall under based on difficulty.</b>
